# Project Scratchpad - Sophia v2 React Starter Kit

## Background and Motivation

This is a comprehensive React Starter Kit project (Sophia v2) built for modern full-stack web application development. The project is designed to eliminate configuration overhead and provide a production-ready foundation for building AI-powered SaaS applications.

**Key Project Characteristics:**
- Full-stack monorepo architecture optimized for Cloudflare Workers
- Modern React 19 with cutting-edge tooling (Bun, TanStack Router, Tailwind CSS v4)
- Type-safe API development with tRPC
- Multi-tenant database architecture with Better Auth
- Edge-first deployment strategy
- AI-first development approach with pre-configured LLM instructions

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Project State
The project appears to be a well-structured template with:
- Complete monorepo setup with apps (app, web, api, edge) and packages (core, ui, ws-protocol)
- Database schema with multi-tenant support (organizations, teams, users)
- Authentication system using Better Auth
- UI component management with shadcn/ui
- Comprehensive documentation
- Infrastructure as code with Terraform
- CI/CD workflows configured

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TanStack Router + Jotai + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Hono framework + tRPC for type-safe APIs
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers with edge optimization
- **Runtime**: Bun for performance and unified tooling

### Development Server Status ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Issue**: The root `bun dev` command uses `concurrently` to start all three servers simultaneously, which caused conflicts and prevented proper startup.

**Solution**: Start each server individually using separate commands:

- **API Server**: `bun run dev:api` ‚Üí http://localhost:8787 ‚úÖ Running (Terminal 4)
- **React App**: `bun --filter @repo/app dev` ‚Üí http://localhost:5173 ‚úÖ Running (Terminal 6)
- **Astro Web Server**: `bun run dev:web` ‚Üí http://localhost:4321 ‚úÖ Running (Terminal 7)

**Status**: All three development servers are now running successfully without conflicts. The React app startup issue was resolved by avoiding the concurrent execution approach.

**Script Update**: Modified root `bun dev` command to only start the React app server instead of all three servers concurrently.

**Next Steps**: Ready to proceed with development tasks - database setup, authentication system, or other features.

### Sidebar-07 Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Issue**: User requested to swap the current sidebar-02 implementation with sidebar-07 for enhanced functionality and better user experience.

**Root Cause**: The application was using sidebar-02 which had a simpler structure, but sidebar-07 provides more advanced features including team switching, enhanced navigation, and better user management.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Installed sidebar-07 component**: Used `bunx shadcn@latest add sidebar-07 --overwrite` to install the new sidebar variant
2. **Updated component exports**: Added `avatar` component export to `packages/ui/index.ts`
3. **Fixed import paths**: Consolidated all imports in nav components (`nav-user.tsx`, `nav-main.tsx`, `nav-projects.tsx`, `team-switcher.tsx`) to use direct `@repo/ui` imports
4. **Customized healthcare data**: Updated `app-sidebar.tsx` with healthcare-relevant navigation:
   - **User**: Dr. Sarah Johnson with Sophia Health email
   - **Teams**: Sophia Health, Medical Center, Research Lab with appropriate icons
   - **Navigation**: Dashboard, Patient Care, Documentation, Settings with medical-focused sub-items
   - **Projects**: Cardiology Unit, Patient Management, Quality Assurance
5. **Added safety checks**: Enhanced `NavUser` component with null checks to prevent runtime errors
6. **Server restart**: Cleared module resolution cache to ensure proper component loading

**Components Updated**:
- `apps/app/components/app-sidebar.tsx` - Updated with healthcare navigation data
- `apps/app/components/nav-user.tsx` - Fixed imports and added safety checks
- `apps/app/components/nav-main.tsx` - Fixed import paths
- `apps/app/components/nav-projects.tsx` - Fixed import paths
- `apps/app/components/team-switcher.tsx` - Fixed import paths
- `packages/ui/index.ts` - Added avatar component export

**Testing Results**:
- ‚úÖ Homepage (http://localhost:5173/) - No errors, sidebar-07 working correctly
- ‚úÖ Care Plans page (http://localhost:5173/care-plans) - Navigation working properly
- ‚úÖ Account page (http://localhost:5173/account) - Consistent sidebar behavior
- ‚úÖ All import errors resolved
- ‚úÖ Team switcher, navigation, and user menu functioning properly
- ‚úÖ Healthcare-focused navigation items and branding implemented

**Key Features of Sidebar-07**:
- **Team Switcher**: Dropdown to switch between different healthcare organizations
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Collapsible main navigation with sub-items
- **Project Management**: Quick access to specific healthcare units/projects
- **User Menu**: Comprehensive user account management with avatar support
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

### Previous Sidebar-02 Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED (REPLACED)

**Issue**: User reported seeing old sidebar and navigation bar instead of the new sidebar-02 design.

**Root Cause**: The main Layout component in `/apps/app/components/layout.tsx` was still using the old sidebar implementation with custom styling and state management, while only the account page had been updated to use the new sidebar-02 pattern.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Updated Layout Component**: Completely rewrote `/apps/app/components/layout.tsx` to use the new sidebar-02 pattern with:
   - `SidebarProvider` for state management
   - `AppSidebar` component for navigation
   - `SidebarInset` for main content area
   - `SidebarTrigger` for collapsible functionality
   - Modern breadcrumb navigation
   - Integrated `NavUser` component

2. **Fixed Import Paths**: Consolidated all component imports to use `@repo/ui` directly instead of submodule paths:
   - Updated `version-switcher.tsx`
   - Updated `search-form.tsx`
   - Updated `app-sidebar.tsx`

3. **Created NavUser Component**: Built `/apps/app/components/nav-user.tsx` with:
   - User avatar display (using div fallback since Avatar components not available)
   - Dropdown menu with user actions
   - Sign out functionality

4. **Updated Navigation Data**: Modified `app-sidebar.tsx` to use application-relevant navigation:
   - Dashboard (Overview, Analytics)
   - Patient Care (Care Plans, Clinical Support, Patient Records)
   - Settings (Account, Preferences, About)

**Testing Results**:
- ‚úÖ Home page (`/`) - New sidebar working
- ‚úÖ Account page (`/account`) - New sidebar working
- ‚úÖ Care Plans page (`/care-plans`) - New sidebar working
- ‚úÖ No browser errors
- ‚úÖ Development server running smoothly
- ‚úÖ Collapsible sidebar functionality working
- ‚úÖ Responsive design maintained

**Status**: The old sidebar and navigation bar have been completely replaced with the modern sidebar-02 design across all application pages.

### Available Commands and Tools
The project includes several management commands:
- Database: `bun --filter @repo/db generate|migrate|seed|studio`
- UI Components: `bun ui:add|list|update|essentials`
- Development: `bun dev|build|test|lint` (NOTE: Use individual dev commands instead)
- Deployment: `bun wrangler deploy`

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Current Task: Ensure Lucide-React Icon Exclusivity

**Objective**: Verify and ensure that lucide-react icons are used exclusively throughout the project, with no full-color icons.

**Analysis Completed**:
1. ‚úÖ lucide-react is properly installed in both UI package (v0.539.0) and app package (v0.539.0)

3. ‚úÖ All UI components (select, checkbox, radio-group, dialog) use lucide-react icons exclusively
4. ‚úÖ No other icon libraries found (react-icons, heroicons, feather-icons, etc.)
5. ‚úÖ No SVG/PNG icon imports detected in code
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Found logo192.png and logo512.png files in public directories (potential full-color icons)
