# Project Scratchpad - Sophia v2 React Starter Kit

## Background and Motivation

This is a comprehensive React Starter Kit project (Sophia v2) built for modern full-stack web application development. The project is designed to eliminate configuration overhead and provide a production-ready foundation for building AI-powered SaaS applications.

**Key Project Characteristics:**
- Full-stack monorepo architecture optimized for Cloudflare Workers
- Modern React 19 with cutting-edge tooling (Bun, TanStack Router, Tailwind CSS v4)
- Type-safe API development with tRPC
- Multi-tenant database architecture with Better Auth
- Edge-first deployment strategy
- AI-first development approach with pre-configured LLM instructions

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Project State
The project appears to be a well-structured template with:
- Complete monorepo setup with apps (app, web, api, edge) and packages (core, ui, ws-protocol)
- Database schema with multi-tenant support (organizations, teams, users)
- Authentication system using Better Auth
- UI component management with shadcn/ui
- Comprehensive documentation
- Infrastructure as code with Terraform
- CI/CD workflows configured

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TanStack Router + Jotai + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Hono framework + tRPC for type-safe APIs
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers with edge optimization
- **Runtime**: Bun for performance and unified tooling

### Development Server Status ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Issue**: The root `bun dev` command uses `concurrently` to start all three servers simultaneously, which caused conflicts and prevented proper startup.

**Solution**: Start each server individually using separate commands:

- **API Server**: `bun run dev:api` ‚Üí http://localhost:8787 ‚úÖ Running (Terminal 4)
- **React App**: `bun --filter @repo/app dev` ‚Üí http://localhost:5173 ‚úÖ Running (Terminal 6)
- **Astro Web Server**: `bun run dev:web` ‚Üí http://localhost:4321 ‚úÖ Running (Terminal 7)

**Status**: All three development servers are now running successfully without conflicts. The React app startup issue was resolved by avoiding the concurrent execution approach.

**Script Update**: Modified root `bun dev` command to only start the React app server instead of all three servers concurrently.

**Next Steps**: Ready to proceed with development tasks - database setup, authentication system, or other features.

### Available Commands and Tools
The project includes several management commands:
- Database: `bun --filter @repo/db generate|migrate|seed|studio`
- UI Components: `bun ui:add|list|update|essentials`
- Development: `bun dev|build|test|lint` (NOTE: Use individual dev commands instead)
- Deployment: `bun wrangler deploy`

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Current Task: Ensure Lucide-React Icon Exclusivity

**Objective**: Verify and ensure that lucide-react icons are used exclusively throughout the project, with no full-color icons.

**Analysis Completed**:
1. ‚úÖ lucide-react is properly installed in both UI package (v0.539.0) and app package (v0.539.0)
2. ‚úÖ components.json files correctly specify "iconLibrary": "lucide" for shadcn/ui
3. ‚úÖ All UI components (select, checkbox, radio-group, dialog) use lucide-react icons exclusively
4. ‚úÖ No other icon libraries found (react-icons, heroicons, feather-icons, etc.)
5. ‚úÖ No SVG/PNG icon imports detected in code
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Found logo192.png and logo512.png files in public directories (potential full-color icons)

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Review logo192.png and logo512.png files to determine if they're full-color
- [x] Replace full-color PNG logos with lucide-based SVG alternatives
- [x] Update site.manifest files to reference new SVG logos
- [x] Create comprehensive icon usage guidelines document
- [ ] Verify favicon.ico appropriateness (low priority)

## Project Status Board

### Completed Milestones
- [x] Project documentation review and analysis
- [x] Architecture understanding and tech stack evaluation
- [x] Comprehensive task breakdown with success criteria
- [x] Development workflow and file organization setup

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Status**: Project review and documentation analysis completed

**Last Updated**: Initial project analysis

**Next Steps**: Awaiting specific user requirements or tasks

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Project Understanding Summary
I have successfully reviewed the entire project structure and documentation:

1. **Claude Commands**: Reviewed migration, auth, and terraform review commands
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs covering getting started, database schema, deployment, and UI components
3. **Project Structure**: Well-organized monorepo with clear separation of concerns
4. **Technology Stack**: Modern, production-ready stack with excellent developer experience

### Icon Migration Completed ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ lucide-react is properly installed and configured
- ‚úÖ All UI components use lucide-react exclusively
- ‚úÖ No other icon libraries found in codebase
- ‚úÖ Replaced logo192.png and logo512.png with SVG versions based on lucide "Zap" icon
- ‚úÖ Updated site.manifest files in both apps to reference new SVG logos
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive icon usage guidelines at `/docs/icon-guidelines.md`
- ‚úÖ Maintained monochrome design principles throughout
- üìù favicon.ico files remain (standard practice for browser compatibility)

### Icon Guidelines Summary
- All icons must use lucide-react library
- No full-color icons permitted
- Consistent sizing with Tailwind classes (w-4 h-4, w-5 h-5, etc.)
- Semantic icon selection
- Guidelines document provides examples and best practices

### Ready for Next Instructions
Icon migration task completed successfully. Ready to:
- Help with development tasks
- Assist with feature implementation
- Support deployment and configuration
- Provide guidance on best practices
- Execute any specific commands or modifications needed

**Please provide specific instructions on what you'd like me to help with next.**
