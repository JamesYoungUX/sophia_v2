# Project Scratchpad - Sophia v2 React Starter Kit

## Background and Motivation

This is a comprehensive React Starter Kit project (Sophia v2) built for modern full-stack web application development. The project is designed to eliminate configuration overhead and provide a production-ready foundation for building AI-powered SaaS applications.

**Key Project Characteristics:**
- Full-stack monorepo architecture optimized for Cloudflare Workers
- Modern React 19 with cutting-edge tooling (Bun, TanStack Router, Tailwind CSS v4)
- Type-safe API development with tRPC
- Multi-tenant database architecture with Better Auth
- Edge-first deployment strategy
- AI-first development approach with pre-configured LLM instructions

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Project State
The project appears to be a well-structured template with:
- Complete monorepo setup with apps (app, web, api, edge) and packages (core, ui, ws-protocol)
- Database schema with multi-tenant support (organizations, teams, users)
- Authentication system using Better Auth
- UI component management with shadcn/ui
- Comprehensive documentation
- Infrastructure as code with Terraform
- CI/CD workflows configured

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TanStack Router + Jotai + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Hono framework + tRPC for type-safe APIs
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers with edge optimization
- **Runtime**: Bun for performance and unified tooling

### Development Server Status ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue**: The `bun --filter @repo/api dev` command was starting multiple server instances simultaneously, causing EADDRINUSE errors on port 8787.

**Root Cause**: Bun's workspace filtering mechanism was executing the dev script multiple times in parallel, and Bun was also trying to auto-serve the exported app due to its fetch method detection.

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Modified start.ts export**: Changed `apps/api/start.ts` to export a server configuration object `{ port: 8787, fetch: app.fetch }` instead of manually calling `Bun.serve()` or just exporting the app
2. **Restored proper dev script**: Reverted `apps/api/package.json` dev script to use `start.ts` (not `index.ts`) since start.ts contains all the middleware setup including database and auth initialization
3. **Eliminated double server startup**: The new export format allows Bun to auto-serve without conflicts from manual server creation

**Current Status**:
- **API Server**: `bun --filter @repo/api dev` → http://localhost:8787 ✅ Running (Terminal 5)
- **React App**: `bun --filter @repo/app dev` → http://localhost:5173 ✅ Running
- **Authentication Endpoints**: Confirmed working - `/api/auth/get-session` returning HTTP 200 with proper null response

**Key Lesson**: The issue was that both `start.ts` (with manual `Bun.serve()`) and Bun's auto-serving were trying to start servers simultaneously. The solution was to let Bun handle the server startup by exporting a proper server configuration object.

**Next Steps**: Ready to proceed with development tasks - database setup, authentication system, or other features.

### Sidebar-07 Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

**Issue**: User requested to swap the current sidebar-02 implementation with sidebar-07 for enhanced functionality and better user experience.

**Root Cause**: The application was using sidebar-02 which had a simpler structure, but sidebar-07 provides more advanced features including team switching, enhanced navigation, and better user management.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Installed sidebar-07 component**: Used `bunx shadcn@latest add sidebar-07 --overwrite` to install the new sidebar variant
2. **Updated component exports**: Added `avatar` component export to `packages/ui/index.ts`
3. **Fixed import paths**: Consolidated all imports in nav components (`nav-user.tsx`, `nav-main.tsx`, `nav-projects.tsx`, `team-switcher.tsx`) to use direct `@repo/ui` imports
4. **Customized healthcare data**: Updated `app-sidebar.tsx` with healthcare-relevant navigation:
   - **User**: Dr. Sarah Johnson with Sophia Health email
   - **Teams**: Sophia Health, Medical Center, Research Lab with appropriate icons
   - **Navigation**: Dashboard, Patient Care, Documentation, Settings with medical-focused sub-items
   - **Projects**: Cardiology Unit, Patient Management, Quality Assurance
5. **Added safety checks**: Enhanced `NavUser` component with null checks to prevent runtime errors
6. **Server restart**: Cleared module resolution cache to ensure proper component loading

**Components Updated**:
- `apps/app/components/app-sidebar.tsx` - Updated with healthcare navigation data
- `apps/app/components/nav-user.tsx` - Fixed imports and added safety checks
- `apps/app/components/nav-main.tsx` - Fixed import paths
- `apps/app/components/nav-projects.tsx` - Fixed import paths
- `apps/app/components/team-switcher.tsx` - Fixed import paths
- `packages/ui/index.ts` - Added avatar component export

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Homepage (http://localhost:5173/) - No errors, sidebar-07 working correctly
- ✅ Care Plans page (http://localhost:5173/care-plans) - Navigation working properly
- ✅ Account page (http://localhost:5173/account) - Consistent sidebar behavior
- ✅ All import errors resolved
- ✅ Team switcher, navigation, and user menu functioning properly
- ✅ Healthcare-focused navigation items and branding implemented

**Key Features of Sidebar-07**:
- **Team Switcher**: Dropdown to switch between different healthcare organizations
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Collapsible main navigation with sub-items
- **Project Management**: Quick access to specific healthcare units/projects
- **User Menu**: Comprehensive user account management with avatar support
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

### Previous Sidebar-02 Implementation ✅ COMPLETED (REPLACED)

**Issue**: User reported seeing old sidebar and navigation bar instead of the new sidebar-02 design.

**Root Cause**: The main Layout component in `/apps/app/components/layout.tsx` was still using the old sidebar implementation with custom styling and state management, while only the account page had been updated to use the new sidebar-02 pattern.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Updated Layout Component**: Completely rewrote `/apps/app/components/layout.tsx` to use the new sidebar-02 pattern with:
   - `SidebarProvider` for state management
   - `AppSidebar` component for navigation
   - `SidebarInset` for main content area
   - `SidebarTrigger` for collapsible functionality
   - Modern breadcrumb navigation
   - Integrated `NavUser` component

2. **Fixed Import Paths**: Consolidated all component imports to use `@repo/ui` directly instead of submodule paths:
   - Updated `version-switcher.tsx`
   - Updated `search-form.tsx`
   - Updated `app-sidebar.tsx`

3. **Created NavUser Component**: Built `/apps/app/components/nav-user.tsx` with:
   - User avatar display (using div fallback since Avatar components not available)
   - Dropdown menu with user actions
   - Sign out functionality

4. **Updated Navigation Data**: Modified `app-sidebar.tsx` to use application-relevant navigation:
   - Dashboard (Overview, Analytics)
   - Patient Care (Care Plans, Clinical Support, Patient Records)
   - Settings (Account, Preferences, About)

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Home page (`/`) - New sidebar working
- ✅ Account page (`/account`) - New sidebar working
- ✅ Care Plans page (`/care-plans`) - New sidebar working
- ✅ No browser errors
- ✅ Development server running smoothly
- ✅ Collapsible sidebar functionality working
- ✅ Responsive design maintained

**Status**: The old sidebar and navigation bar have been completely replaced with the modern sidebar-02 design across all application pages.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

- DB Migration Resolution (Care Exceptions):
  - Ran `bun run check` in db workspace.
  - Result: "Everything's fine 🐶🔥" — config/env loaded correctly; ready to attempt `push`.

- Care Exceptions UI Toggle Integration — Executor Update:
  - Step A completed: Added shadcn/ui Toggle to shared UI package and exported from packages/ui/index.ts; changes committed.
  - Step B completed: Replaced Switch with Toggle chip (variant=default, size=sm) on Care Exceptions page; wired to escalatedOnly with onPressedChange and DEBUG_LOG gated.
  - Next: Visual QA and verify humanized timestamps rendering, then clean up logs and commit.
  - Import path now available to consumers: Toggle from @repo/ui.
  - Next (Step B): Replace Switch with Toggle chip in Care Exceptions route and bind to escalatedOnly state. Awaiting approval to proceed.
  - Proceeding per approval with `bun run push` next to reconcile schema non-destructively and create `care_exception` if needed.

### ✅ RESOLVED: Schema Changes Reverted

**Issue Resolved**: All unauthorized schema changes have been successfully reverted.

**What Was Restored**:
- `db/schema/user.ts` - restored `uuid_generate_v7()` in user, session, identity, and verification tables
- `db/schema/organization.ts` - restored `uuid_generate_v7()` in organization and member tables  
- `db/schema/invitation.ts` - restored `uuid_generate_v7()` in invitation table
- `db/schema/team.ts` - restored `uuid_generate_v7()` in team and team_member tables

**Current Status**: All schema files are back to their original state using `uuid_generate_v7()` as intended.

**Next Steps**: We need to properly install the `pg_uuidv7` extension on your PostgreSQL installation to support the UUID v7 generation functions used in your schema.

## Authentication Architecture Analysis

### Current Implementation Status: ✅ CORRECT APPROACH

After thorough investigation of the user's concern about bypassing the root layout for authentication pages, the current implementation is **architecturally sound** and follows best practices:

#### What We Preserved (Essential):
- **StoreProvider**: Maintains Jotai state management for authentication state
- **Outlet**: Renders the actual route components
- **TanStackRouterDevtools**: Development tools for debugging

#### What We Bypassed (UI Only):
- **Layout Component**: Contains sidebar, breadcrumbs, and navigation UI
- **AppSidebar**: Main navigation sidebar
- **Breadcrumb**: Navigation breadcrumbs
- **NavUser**: User navigation component

## Login Page Design Implementation: ✅ COMPLETED

### shadcn/ui login-02 Pattern Implementation

Successfully updated the login page to match the **shadcn/ui login-02** design pattern:

#### Design Features Implemented:
- **Two-Column Layout**: Grid layout with `lg:grid-cols-2` for desktop
- **Left Column**: Contains branding, login form, and proper spacing
- **Right Column**: Features a healthcare-themed cover image with muted background
- **Brand Identity**: Added Sophia Health logo with custom healthcare icon
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements
- **Professional Imagery**: Healthcare professionals collaboration image from Unsplash
- **Dark Mode Support**: Image brightness and grayscale adjustments for dark theme

#### Technical Implementation:
- Updated `/routes/login.tsx` with proper grid layout structure
- Maintained existing authentication logic and error handling
- Preserved `LoginForm` component functionality
- Added responsive breakpoints for optimal mobile/desktop experience
- Integrated with existing design system and theme variables

#### User Experience:
- Clean, professional healthcare-focused design
- Improved visual hierarchy and brand presence
- Better use of screen real estate on larger displays
- Maintains accessibility and form functionality
- Seamless integration with existing authentication flow

#### Authentication Flow Verification:
1. **Protected Routes**: Home route (`/`) has `beforeLoad` authentication guard
2. **State Management**: `StoreProvider` ensures auth state is available on all routes
3. **Session Handling**: Better Auth client works independently of UI layout
4. **Redirect Logic**: Unauthenticated users are properly redirected

#### Why This Approach is Correct:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Authentication logic is separate from UI layout
- **State Preservation**: Critical state management providers are maintained
- **Clean UX**: Auth pages have standalone design without app chrome
- **Security**: No authentication functionality is compromised

### Conclusion
The conditional layout rendering in `__root.tsx` is the **recommended pattern** for handling authentication pages in TanStack Router applications. It preserves essential functionality while providing clean, focused auth experiences.

## Care Exceptions P0 - Executor Mode

Background and Motivation (Appended)
- Implement P0 slice of Care Exceptions to support tracking of issues detected by agents (e.g., Compliance Agent) with AI-driven escalation. Escalation is an identifier (not a button) and implies high severity. Default escalatedByType=agent and escalatedByAgent=compliance for AI-triggered escalations.

Key Challenges and Analysis (Appended)
- Ensure DB schema follows existing Drizzle patterns (UUIDv7 PKs, snake_case columns, timestamps with timezone)
- tRPC router must enforce business rules: AI escalations force severity=high; provide list filters and pagination
- Frontend route currently uses static mock data and includes an Actions column; we must remove the "Escalate" button, show an "Escalated" badge (with timestamp when available), and add a filter for escalated-only
- Keep scripts modular and logging toggleable via DEBUG_LOG; avoid adding code to very large files; separate concerns cleanly

High-level Task Breakdown (Care Exceptions P0)
1) DB Schema and Migration
   - Add care_exception table schema with fields: id, patient_id, type, severity, status, first_detected_at, last_detected_at, resolved_at, escalated, escalated_at, escalated_by_type, escalated_by_agent (default "compliance"), escalation_reason, note, created_at, updated_at
   - Export schema in db/schema/index.ts
   - Generate and apply migration
   - Success: Migration runs, table present and queryable
2) API Router
   - Create apps/api/routers/care-exception.ts with procedures: list, getById, create, update, updateStatus; input validation via zod
   - Wire router in apps/api/index.ts under `careException`
   - Success: Endpoints callable and enforce business rules
3) Frontend Route Wiring
   - Replace mock data in apps/app/routes/care-exceptions.tsx with tRPC calls
   - Remove "Escalate" action; add "Escalated" badge and an escalated-only filter chip; keep strong typing
   - Success: Page renders from API; actions reflect new identifier-only model
4) QA + Optional Seed/Debug Scripts
   - Add DEBUG_LOG toggles; smoke test API calls; optional seed records and a debug script under /debug
   - Success: Manual smoke tests pass; minimal seed available if needed

Project Status Board (Appended)
- Care Exceptions P0
  - [x] Step 1a: DB migration generated (0005_add-care-exception.sql)
  - [x] Step 1b: DB migration applied via non-destructive push (care_exception created successfully)
  - [x] Step 1: Schema file created and exported (code)
  - [x] Step 2: API router created and wired into app router (code)
  - [ ] Step 3: Frontend route updated (remove Escalate button, add badge/filter; wire API)
  - [ ] Step 4: QA + optional seed/debug scripts

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Status**: Patient data updated ✅

**Last Updated**: Successfully replaced "John Doe" patient name with "Alexander James Mitchell" in seed data

**Recent Completion**: 
- ✅ **Patient Status Update**: Modified patient-pool.tsx to display "On Track" status with green indicator instead of pulling from "alive" database column
- ✅ **UI Enhancement**: Improved user experience with more appropriate status terminology
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Simplified status logic by removing conditional checks
- ✅ **Patient Data Update**: Replaced generic "John Doe" placeholder with "Alexander James Mitchell" in seed data
- ✅ **Data Quality**: Updated all related name fields and email address for consistency

**Next Steps**: Ready for next user request or feature implementation

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

1) Migration resolution options (please choose one):
   - A) Non-destructive: Mark migration "0005_add-care-exception" as applied without changes after verifying the existing care_exception table matches the schema. I can create a small debug script in /debug to introspect the table (columns, types, defaults, constraints) and report. Then I will record the migration as applied. No data loss.
   - B) Destructive (only if safe): Drop the existing care_exception table in the Neon DB and re-run `bun --filter @repo/db migrate` so the migration applies cleanly. This removes any existing data in that table.
   - C) Conditional migration: Modify 0005 migration to conditionally create table/constraints using DO blocks to skip duplicates. More complex but preserves existing data.
   - D) Use `drizzle-kit push` for this environment to sync schema without migrations, then continue using migrations going forward (not ideal as it diverges migration history).

2) Commit strategy for pre-commit hook failure:
   - Option 1) Allow me to commit with `--no-verify` to bypass Husky this time
   - Option 2) I add a minimal placeholder test (e.g., tests/smoke.test.ts) so `bun test` passes, then commit normally
   - Option 3) Adjust Husky pre-commit to skip tests for now (tooling change)

3) Optional: Approve me to run a read-only DB inspection script (in /debug) that lists public tables and details of care_exception to validate current structure before we choose path A/B/C. This will help avoid surprises. I will not modify data.

Once the migration path and commit strategy are confirmed, I will:
- Complete DB step (apply or record migration as per choice)
- Proceed to Frontend wiring (replace mock data with tRPC, remove Escalate button, add Escalated badge/filter)
- Provide a UI preview before marking UI changes complete

Care Exceptions P0 Progress Update
- Executed: Generated migration via `bun --filter @repo/db generate --name add-care-exception` → created db/migrations/0005_add-care-exception.sql
- Executed: Attempted `bun --filter @repo/db migrate` → FAILED with Postgres error 42P07 (relation already exists) when creating table care_exception
- Executed: Aligned WRANGLER_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_* values in .env.local to match active DATABASE_URL per approval
- Pending: Git commit of changes (pre-commit hook failed due to bun test reporting "No tests found!")

BFROS: Migration Failure Analysis (if DEBUG_LOG)
- If (DEBUG_LOG) Potential causes considered:
  1) care_exception table pre-exists in the Neon database from prior manual/testing work
  2) Migration was applied in another environment/branch against the same DB
  3) A partially created table/constraint exists due to earlier aborted runs
  4) Schema naming mismatch (public vs other schema) causing duplicate create
  5) Previous non-migration SQL created the table (e.g., via push or studio)
  6) Concurrent migration attempt created the table just before current run
  7) Drizzle meta journal not recording prior state for this DB
- If (DEBUG_LOG) Most likely sources: (1) Pre-existing table in Neon DB, (5) Prior push/studio/manual create
- If (DEBUG_LOG) Next validation step proposed: Run a read-only script to list tables/columns and verify care_exception structure matches expected before deciding resolution path

## Care Exceptions Frontend Wiring — Planner Update (Planner Mode)

Objective
- Replace mock data with live tRPC API in the Care Exceptions page, adjust UI (remove Escalate button, add Escalated badge), and add an Escalated-only filter, with strong typing, gated debug logs, and tests.

Primary Files in Scope
- Frontend route: <mcfile name="care-exceptions.tsx" path="/Users/jamesyoung/Documents/sites/sophia2/sophia_v2/apps/app/routes/care-exceptions.tsx"></mcfile>
- Frontend tRPC client: <mcfile name="trpc.ts" path="/Users/jamesyoung/Documents/sites/sophia2/sophia_v2/apps/app/lib/trpc.ts"></mcfile>
- Frontend providers: <mcfile name="providers.tsx" path="/Users/jamesyoung/Documents/sites/sophia2/sophia_v2/apps/app/lib/providers.tsx"></mcfile>
- API router (read-only reference): <mcfile name="care-exception.ts" path="/Users/jamesyoung/Documents/sites/sophia2/sophia_v2/apps/api/routers/care-exception.ts"></mcfile>

Current State Recap
- The route component renders a table using placeholder data and computes summary stats locally. Authentication guard is in place via requireAuth.
- tRPC client is already configured and provided to the app, pointing to http://localhost:8787/api/trpc.

Design Options Considered (choose the simplest DRY approach)
1) Direct useQuery in the route component
   - Pros: Minimal code, fastest path. Cons: Harder to test and evolve; logic mixed with UI; reuse is limited.
2) Extract a small useCareExceptions hook that wraps api.careException.list.useQuery (Chosen)
   - Pros: Clean separation of data concerns, easy to unit test, reuse across components, small surface area; aligns with modularity requirements.
   - Cons: Slight indirection but negligible.
3) Jotai store for filters + custom fetcher
   - Pros: Centralized state for future pages. Cons: Overkill for current scope; duplicates react-query caching.
4) Route loader-based prefetch
   - Pros: Potentially better for SSR/prefetch later. Cons: Adds routing complexity now and we already have react-query/tRPC idioms.
5) Suspense + ErrorBoundary wrappers
   - Pros: Clean UI patterns for states. Cons: Not required to ship P0; can be a later enhancement.

Plan of Record (Approach 2)
- Implement a focused hook useCareExceptions with params { escalatedOnly?: boolean; severity?: Severity[]; status?: Status[]; patientId?: string } that internally calls api.careException.list.useQuery.
- Update the route component to consume the hook, wire loading/empty/error states, map records to UI, remove the Escalate button/column, and add an Escalated badge when escalatedAt is present.
- Add a simple Escalated-only filter chip/toggle that refetches with escalatedOnly=true.
- Add gated DEBUG_LOG logging and ensure functions remain below size limits; split helper functions as needed.

High-level Task Breakdown with Success Criteria
A) Data integration via tRPC
   - Tasks: Create useCareExceptions hook; replace placeholder data; ensure type-safety using AppRouter types; compute summary from API data.
   - Success: Table renders real records; no TS errors; network request visible; summary counts match dataset.
B) UI adjustments
   - Tasks: Remove Escalate column/button; add Escalated badge with optional timestamp formatting.
   - Success: No Escalate UI present; Escalated badge only appears for records with escalatedAt.
C) Escalated-only filter
   - Tasks: Add a chip/toggle; persist state locally; pass to hook as escalatedOnly.
   - Success: Toggling filter changes query key and result set; visual feedback shows filtered count.
D) Loading/empty/error states
   - Tasks: Show skeleton/spinner while loading; empty-state card if no results; inline error banner with retry.
   - Success: Each state is reachable and legible; retry triggers refetch.
E) Observability and debug logging (gated)
   - Tasks: Add DEBUG_LOG flag; pre/post fetch logs; state transition logs; include variable shape previews.
   - Success: When DEBUG_LOG=true, logs are comprehensive yet focused; when false, no extra logs.
F) Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library, mock tRPC)
   - Tasks: Unit tests for badge rendering, filter behavior, and empty/error states.
   - Success: Tests pass locally; cover primary behaviors without real network calls.
G) Preview
   - Tasks: Manual verification on /care-exceptions; quick UI checklist (counts, badges, filters, states).
   - Success: Visual/functional parity with requirements confirmed.

Data Contract and Key Fields (reference only; align with API types)
- id, patientId, type, severity, status, createdAt, updatedAt, escalatedAt?, escalatedByType?, escalatedByAgent?.
- We will map to: case ID, patient name/ID (if available in record or via future join), severity, status, created date, escalated badge when escalatedAt exists.

Testing Plan Details
- Use happy-dom test environment already configured in the app workspace.
- Mock tRPC via wrapper of api.Provider with a mocked client for unit tests.
- Test cases:
  - Renders rows and summary using provided mock data.
  - Escalated badge appears only when escalatedAt is defined.
  - Escalated-only filter narrows results and updates table/summary.
  - Loading state snapshot; Error state displays banner with retry invoking refetch.

Observability Plan
- Introduce a module-level DEBUG_LOG boolean in the route file or extracted hook.
- Log input params, query keys, response counts, and state transitions with clear prefixes.
- Ensure logs can be turned off centrally by flipping the flag.

Constraints and Conventions to Honor
- No CSS in TSX files; keep existing styles.
- Keep functions under 200 lines; files under 400 lines; extract helpers if needed.
- Do not restart servers unless explicitly instructed.
- Prefer editing existing files; avoid creating new ones unless modularization requires.

Risks & Mitigations
- Data shape drift: Mitigate by using AppRouter types from tRPC and narrowing where necessary.
- UI regression: Mitigate via incremental changes and tests for key behaviors.
- Overfetching on filter: Ensure query keys include filter params to leverage caching and prevent stale data.

Approval Request
- Please confirm this plan and specify if you want me to proceed with Step A (Data integration via tRPC) in Executor mode. I will implement incrementally, add gated logs, and report back with verifiable outcomes before moving to the next step.
- Optionally, approve creating a tiny seed/debug script to insert 2-3 sample care exceptions for visual verification if DB is empty.

Executor Handoff Request
- Please confirm: Proceed with Step 3.A now in Executor mode?

1) Migration resolution options (please choose one):
   - A) Non-destructive: Mark migration "0005_add-care-exception" as applied without changes after verifying the existing care_exception table matches the schema. I can create a small debug script in /debug to introspect the table (columns, types, defaults, constraints) and report. Then I will record the migration as applied. No data loss.
   - B) Destructive (only if safe): Drop the existing care_exception table in the Neon DB and re-run `bun --filter @repo/db migrate` so the migration applies cleanly. This removes any existing data in that table.
   - C) Conditional migration: Modify 0005 migration to conditionally create table/constraints using DO blocks to skip duplicates. More complex but preserves existing data.
   - D) Use `drizzle-kit push` for this environment to sync schema without migrations, then continue using migrations going forward (not ideal as it diverges migration history).

2) Commit strategy for pre-commit hook failure:
   - Option 1) Allow me to commit with `--no-verify` to bypass Husky this time
   - Option 2) I add a minimal placeholder test (e.g., tests/smoke.test.ts) so `bun test` passes, then commit normally
   - Option 3) Adjust Husky pre-commit to skip tests for now (tooling change)

3) Optional: Approve me to run a read-only DB inspection script (in /debug) that lists public tables and details of care_exception to validate current structure before we choose path A/B/C. This will help avoid surprises. I will not modify data.

Once the migration path and commit strategy are confirmed, I will:
- Complete DB step (apply or record migration as per choice)
- Proceed to Frontend wiring (replace mock data with tRPC, remove Escalate button, add Escalated badge/filter)
- Provide a UI preview before marking UI changes complete

Care Exceptions P0 Progress Update
- Executed: Generated migration via `bun --filter @repo/db generate --name add-care-exception` → created db/migrations/0005_add-care-exception.sql
- Executed: Attempted `bun --filter @repo/db migrate` → FAILED with Postgres error 42P07 (relation already exists) when creating table care_exception
- Executed: Aligned WRANGLER_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_* values in .env.local to match active DATABASE_URL per approval
- Pending: Git commit of changes (pre-commit hook failed due to bun test reporting "No tests found!")

BFROS: Migration Failure Analysis (if DEBUG_LOG)
- If (DEBUG_LOG) Potential causes considered:
  1) care_exception table pre-exists in the Neon database from prior manual/testing work
  2) Migration was applied in another environment/branch against the same DB
  3) A partially created table/constraint exists due to earlier aborted runs
  4) Schema naming mismatch (public vs other schema) causing duplicate create
  5) Previous non-migration SQL created the table (e.g., via push or studio)
  6) Concurrent migration attempt created the table just before current run
  7) Drizzle meta journal not recording prior state for this DB
- If (DEBUG_LOG) Most likely sources: (1) Pre-existing table in Neon DB, (5) Prior push/studio/manual create
- If (DEBUG_LOG) Next validation step proposed: Run a read-only script to list tables/columns and verify care_exception structure matches expected before deciding resolution path

## Care Exceptions Frontend Wiring — Planner Update (Planner Mode)

Background and Motivation
- The Care Exceptions page currently uses a Switch to control the "Escalated only" filter. We want a compact chip-style control consistent with shadcn/ui patterns, using Toggle (single) rather than ToggleGroup, while keeping accessibility, DEBUG_LOG-gated observability, and tests aligned with project conventions.

Key Challenges and Analysis
- UI Consistency: Ensure the new Toggle matches existing design tokens and variants from the shared UI library.
- Package Reuse: Prefer centralized export via @repo/ui to keep DRY and avoid per-app duplicates.
- Accessibility: Toggle must be keyboard and screen-reader friendly with clear label association.
- Minimal Surface Change: Replace only the Switch control and wiring without altering the underlying data fetching logic previously planned for filters.

Design Options Considered
1) Keep Switch and restyle — Minimal code, but not the desired chip UX.
2) Use shadcn/ui Toggle (Chosen) — Compact, standard pattern, easy to read as a filter chip.
3) Use ToggleGroup single-select — Overkill for a single boolean; reserve for future multi-filter chips.

Plan of Record
- Add shadcn/ui Toggle component to the shared UI library and export it.
- Update the Care Exceptions route to replace the Switch with the Toggle chip, maintaining the same escalatedOnly boolean state and onChange handler semantics.
- Ensure proper aria-label and visible label text; keep the "Escalated only" text visible near the control.
- Keep logs gated behind a module-level DEBUG_LOG constant.

High-level Task Breakdown with Success Criteria
A) Add Toggle to @repo/ui
   - Tasks: Install/add Toggle via existing shadcn/ui tooling in the UI package; export from the shared index.
   - Success: Importing Toggle from @repo/ui works in the app; no bundling or type errors.
   - Files in scope: <mcfile name="index.ts" path="/Users/jamesyoung/Documents/sites/sophia2/sophia_v2/packages/ui/index.ts"></mcfile> plus new component under packages/ui/components.

B) Replace Switch with Toggle in Care Exceptions
   - Tasks: Replace the Switch control with Toggle in the route; bind to escalatedOnly; preserve controlled component behavior and visual label.
   - Success: Clicking the Toggle toggles state and refetch (when data integration is wired); UI looks like a chip and remains accessible.
   - File in scope: <mcfile name="care-exceptions.tsx" path="/Users/jamesyoung/Documents/sites/sophia2/sophia_v2/apps/app/routes/care-exceptions.tsx"></mcfile>

C) Verify humanized timestamps
   - Tasks: Review usage of humanizeTime to ensure consistency in cells for firstDetectedAt, lastDetectedAt, escalatedAt.
   - Success: All timestamp displays remain correct and consistent after UI change.

D) Visual QA and Preview
   - Tasks: Manually verify the page renders correctly, Toggle chip aligns with design, and provide a preview URL.
   - Success: No console errors; Toggle behaves as expected; preview shared.

E) Cleanup and Commit
   - Tasks: Ensure DEBUG_LOG gating is respected; remove or disable excessive logs; commit with clear summary.
   - Success: Changes are committed with concise messages; DEBUG_LOG controls any remaining verbose logs.

Testing Plan
- Add/adjust unit tests to cover Toggle-controlled state transitions and rendering of the Escalated badge logic where applicable.
- Keep tests isolated and, where network behavior is involved later, prefer mocks.

Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Missing export from @repo/ui breaks imports. Mitigation: Add export and run type check before UI changes.
- Risk: Style mismatch vs. app theme. Mitigation: Use shadcn/ui defaults and variants consistent with other components.
- Risk: Accessibility regressions. Mitigation: Maintain visible label and aria-label; test keyboard navigation.

Approval Request
- Please confirm to proceed in Executor mode with Step A) Add Toggle to @repo/ui, followed by Step B) Replace the Switch with Toggle in the Care Exceptions page.

Current State Recap
- The route component renders a table using placeholder data and computes summary stats locally. Authentication guard is in place via requireAuth.
- tRPC client is already configured and provided to the app, pointing to http://localhost:8787/api/trpc.

Design Options Considered (choose the simplest DRY approach)
1) Direct useQuery in the route component
   - Pros: Minimal code, fastest path. Cons: Harder to test and evolve; logic mixed with UI; reuse is limited.
2) Extract a small useCareExceptions hook that wraps api.careException.list.useQuery (Chosen)
   - Pros: Clean separation of data concerns, easy to unit test, reuse across components, small surface area; aligns with modularity requirements.
   - Cons: Slight indirection but negligible.
3) Jotai store for filters + custom fetcher
   - Pros: Centralized state for future pages. Cons: Overkill for current scope; duplicates react-query caching.
4) Route loader-based prefetch
   - Pros: Potentially better for SSR/prefetch later. Cons: Adds routing complexity now and we already have react-query/tRPC idioms.
5) Suspense + ErrorBoundary wrappers
   - Pros: Clean UI patterns for states. Cons: Not required to ship P0; can be a later enhancement.

Plan of Record (Approach 2)
- Implement a focused hook useCareExceptions with params { escalatedOnly?: boolean; severity?: Severity[]; status?: Status[]; patientId?: string } that internally calls api.careException.list.useQuery.
- Update the route component to consume the hook, wire loading/empty/error states, map records to UI, remove the Escalate button/column, and add an Escalated badge when escalatedAt is present.
- Add a simple Escalated-only filter chip/toggle that refetches with escalatedOnly=true.
- Add gated DEBUG_LOG logging and ensure functions remain below size limits; split helper functions as needed.

High-level Task Breakdown with Success Criteria
A) Data integration via tRPC
   - Tasks: Create useCareExceptions hook; replace placeholder data; ensure type-safety using AppRouter types; compute summary from API data.
   - Success: Table renders real records; no TS errors; network request visible; summary counts match dataset.
B) UI adjustments
   - Tasks: Remove Escalate column/button; add Escalated badge with optional timestamp formatting.
   - Success: No Escalate UI present; Escalated badge only appears for records with escalatedAt.
C) Escalated-only filter
   - Tasks: Add a chip/toggle; persist state locally; pass to hook as escalatedOnly.
   - Success: Toggling filter changes query key and result set; visual feedback shows filtered count.
D) Loading/empty/error states
   - Tasks: Show skeleton/spinner while loading; empty-state card if no results; inline error banner with retry.
   - Success: Each state is reachable and legible; retry triggers refetch.
E) Observability and debug logging (gated)
   - Tasks: Add DEBUG_LOG flag; pre/post fetch logs; state transition logs; include variable shape previews.
   - Success: When DEBUG_LOG=true, logs are comprehensive yet focused; when false, no extra logs.
F) Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library, mock tRPC)
   - Tasks: Unit tests for badge rendering, filter behavior, and empty/error states.
   - Success: Tests pass locally; cover primary behaviors without real network calls.
G) Preview

- Do not restart servers unless explicitly instructed.
- Prefer editing existing files; avoid creating new ones unless modularization requires.

Risks & Mitigations
- Data shape drift: Mitigate by using AppRouter types from tRPC and narrowing where necessary.
- UI regression: Mitigate via incremental changes and tests for key behaviors.
- Overfetching on filter: Ensure query keys include filter params to leverage caching and prevent stale data.

Approval Request
- Please confirm this plan and specify if you want me to proceed with Step A (Data integration via tRPC) in Executor mode. I will implement incrementally, add gated logs, and report back with verifiable outcomes before moving to the next step.
- Optionally, approve creating a tiny seed/debug script to insert 2-3 sample care exceptions for visual verification if DB is empty.

Executor Handoff Request
- Please confirm: Proceed with Step 3.A now in Executor mode?

1) Migration resolution options (please choose one):
   - A) Non-destructive: Mark migration "0005_add-care-exception" as applied without changes after verifying the existing care_exception table matches the schema. I can create a small debug script in /debug to introspect the table (columns, types, defaults, constraints) and report. Then I will record the migration as applied. No data loss.
   - B) Destructive (only if safe): Drop the existing care_exception table in the Neon DB and re-run `bun --filter @repo/db migrate` so the migration applies cleanly. This removes any existing data in that table.
   - C) Conditional migration: Modify 0005 migration to conditionally create table/constraints using DO blocks to skip duplicates. More complex but preserves existing data.
   - D) Use `drizzle-kit push` for this environment to sync schema without migrations, then continue using migrations going forward (not ideal as it diverges migration history).

2) Commit strategy for pre-commit hook failure:
   - Option 1) Allow me to commit with `--no-verify` to bypass Husky this time
   - Option 2) I add a minimal placeholder test (e.g., tests/smoke.test.ts) so `bun test` passes, then commit normally
   - Option 3) Adjust Husky pre-commit to skip tests for now (tooling change)

3) Optional: Approve me to run a read-only DB inspection script (in /debug) that lists public tables and details of care_exception to validate current structure before we choose path A/B/C. This will help avoid surprises. I will not modify data.

Once the migration path and commit strategy are confirmed, I will:
- Complete DB step (apply or record migration as per choice)
- Proceed to Frontend wiring (replace mock data with tRPC, remove Escalate button, add Escalated badge/filter)
- Provide a UI preview before marking UI changes complete

Care Exceptions P0 Progress Update
- Executed: Generated migration via `bun --filter @repo/db generate --name add-care-exception` → created db/migrations/0005_add-care-exception.sql
- Executed: Attempted `bun --filter @repo/db migrate` → FAILED with Postgres error 42P07 (relation already exists) when creating table care_exception
- Executed: Aligned WRANGLER_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_* values in .env.local to match active DATABASE_URL per approval
- Pending: Git commit of changes (pre-commit hook failed due to bun test reporting "No tests found!")

BFROS: Migration Failure Analysis (if DEBUG_LOG)
- If (DEBUG_LOG) Potential causes considered:
  1) care_exception table pre-exists in the Neon database from prior manual/testing work
  2) Migration was applied in another environment/branch against the same DB
  3) A partially created table/constraint exists due to earlier aborted runs
  4) Schema naming mismatch (public vs other schema) causing duplicate create
  5) Previous non-migration SQL created the table (e.g., via push or studio)
  6) Concurrent migration attempt created the table just before current run
  7) Drizzle meta journal not recording prior state for this DB
- If (DEBUG_LOG) Most likely sources: (1) Pre-existing table in Neon DB, (5) Prior push/studio/manual create
- If (DEBUG_LOG) Next validation step proposed: Run a read-only script to list tables/columns and verify care_exception structure matches expected before deciding resolution path

## Care Exceptions Frontend Wiring — Planner Update (Planner Mode)

Background and Motivation
- The Care Exceptions page currently uses a Switch to control the "Escalated only" filter. We want a compact chip-style control consistent with shadcn/ui patterns, using Toggle (single) rather than ToggleGroup, while keeping accessibility, DEBUG_LOG-gated observability, and tests aligned with project conventions.

Key Challenges and Analysis
- UI Consistency: Ensure the new Toggle matches existing design tokens and variants from the shared UI library.
- Package Reuse: Prefer centralized export via @repo/ui to keep DRY and avoid per-app duplicates.
- Accessibility: Toggle must be keyboard and screen-reader friendly with clear label association.
- Minimal Surface Change: Replace only the Switch control and wiring without altering the underlying data fetching logic previously planned for filters.

Design Options Considered
1) Keep Switch and restyle — Minimal code, but not the desired chip UX.
2) Use shadcn/ui Toggle (Chosen) — Compact, standard pattern, easy to read as a filter chip.
3) Use ToggleGroup single-select — Overkill for a single boolean; reserve for future multi-filter chips.

Plan of Record
- Add shadcn/ui Toggle component to the shared UI library and export it.
- Update the Care Exceptions route to replace the Switch with the Toggle chip, maintaining the same escalatedOnly boolean state and onChange handler semantics.
- Ensure proper aria-label and visible label text; keep the "Escalated only" text visible near the control.
- Keep logs gated behind a module-level DEBUG_LOG constant.

High-level Task Breakdown with Success Criteria
A) Add Toggle to @repo/ui
   - Tasks: Install/add Toggle via existing shadcn/ui tooling in the UI package; export from the shared index.
   - Success: Importing Toggle from @repo/ui works in the app; no bundling or type errors.
   - Files in scope: <mcfile name="index.ts" path="/Users/jamesyoung/Documents/sites/sophia2/sophia_v2/packages/ui/index.ts"></mcfile> plus new component under packages/ui/components.

B) Replace Switch with Toggle in Care Exceptions
   - Tasks: Replace the Switch control with Toggle in the route; bind to escalatedOnly; preserve controlled component behavior and visual label.
   - Success: Clicking the Toggle toggles state and refetch (when data integration is wired); UI looks like a chip and remains accessible.
   - File in scope: <mcfile name="care-exceptions.tsx" path="/Users/jamesyoung/Documents/sites/sophia2/sophia_v2/apps/app/routes/care-exceptions.tsx"></mcfile>

C) Verify humanized timestamps
   - Tasks: Review usage of humanizeTime to ensure consistency in cells for firstDetectedAt, lastDetectedAt, escalatedAt.
   - Success: All timestamp displays remain correct and consistent after UI change.

D) Visual QA and Preview
   - Tasks: Manually verify the page renders correctly, Toggle chip aligns with design, and provide a preview URL.
   - Success: No console errors; Toggle behaves as expected; preview shared.

E) Cleanup and Commit
   - Tasks: Ensure DEBUG_LOG gating is respected; remove or disable excessive logs; commit with clear summary.
   - Success: Changes are committed with concise messages; DEBUG_LOG controls any remaining verbose logs.

Testing Plan
- Add/adjust unit tests to cover Toggle-controlled state transitions and rendering of the Escalated badge logic where applicable.
- Keep tests isolated and, where network behavior is involved later, prefer mocks.

Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Missing export from @repo/ui breaks imports. Mitigation: Add export and run type check before UI changes.
- Risk: Style mismatch vs. app theme. Mitigation: Use shadcn/ui defaults and variants consistent with other components.
- Risk: Accessibility regressions. Mitigation: Maintain visible label and aria-label; test keyboard navigation.

Approval Request
- Please confirm to proceed in Executor mode with Step A) Add Toggle to @repo/ui, followed by Step B) Replace the Switch with Toggle in the Care Exceptions page.

Current State Recap
- The route component renders a table using placeholder data and computes summary stats locally. Authentication guard is in place via requireAuth.
- tRPC client is already configured and provided to the app, pointing to http://localhost:8787/api/trpc.

Design Options Considered (choose the simplest DRY approach)
1) Direct useQuery in the route component
   - Pros: Minimal code, fastest path. Cons: Harder to test and evolve; logic mixed with UI; reuse is limited.
2) Extract a small useCareExceptions hook that wraps api.careException.list.useQuery (Chosen)
   - Pros: Clean separation of data concerns, easy to unit test, reuse across components, small surface area; aligns with modularity requirements.
   - Cons: Slight indirection but negligible.
3) Jotai store for filters + custom fetcher
   - Pros: Centralized state for future pages. Cons: Overkill for current scope; duplicates react-query caching.
4) Route loader-based prefetch
   - Pros: Potentially better for SSR/prefetch later. Cons: Adds routing complexity now and we already have react-query/tRPC idioms.
5) Suspense + ErrorBoundary wrappers
   - Pros: Clean UI patterns for states. Cons: Not required to ship P0; can be a later enhancement.

Plan of Record (Approach 2)
- Implement a focused hook useCareExceptions with params { escalatedOnly?: boolean; severity?: Severity[]; status?: Status[]; patientId?: string } that internally calls api.careException.list.useQuery.
- Update the route component to consume the hook, wire loading/empty/error states, map records to UI, remove the Escalate button/column, and add an Escalated badge when escalated
