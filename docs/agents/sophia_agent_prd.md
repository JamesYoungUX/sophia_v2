## Appendices

### A. Sample Conversation Flows
#### Pre-Surgery Anxiety Management
```
Sophia: Hi Maria! I noticed your surgery is tomorrow morning. How are you feeling about everything?

Maria: Honestly, I'm really nervous. I've never had surgery before.

Sophia: That's completely understandable, Maria. It's normal to feel anxious before your first surgery. Dr. Smith and the team have done hundreds of knee replacements - you're in excellent hands. Would it help if I walked you through what to expect tomorrow morning?

Maria: Yes, that would be really helpful.

Sophia: Great! I'll send you a step-by-step guide, and we can go through any questions you have. Also, I've noticed some patients find the relaxation exercises helpful. Would you like me to share some breathing techniques you can use tonight and tomorrow morning?
```

#### Post-Surgery Complication Detection
```
Maria: Sophia, I'm worried about my incision. It looks more red than yesterday.

Sophia: I understand your concern, Maria. Let me ask a few questions to better help you. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate any pain or tenderness around the incision compared to yesterday?

Maria: Maybe a 7? It was about a 4 yesterday.

Sophia: Thank you for that information. Has there been any unusual drainage, warmth, or fever? Even a small increase in temperature?

Maria: Now that you mention it, I did feel a bit warm this morning.

Sophia: Maria, based on what you're describing, I think it's important for Dr. Smith's team to take a look at your incision today. I'm going to contact them right now and arrange for someone to see you within the next few hours. This is likely something easily treatable, but it's better to check. Is that okay with you?
