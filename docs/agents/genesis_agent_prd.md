# Genesis Agent - Evidence-Based Care Plan Optimization PRD

## Executive Summary

Genesis Agent is the intelligent clinical decision support system that continuously monitors medical literature, clinical guidelines, and real-world outcomes to suggest evidence-based improvements to surgical care plans. Unlike patient-facing agents, Genesis works behind the scenes with clinical teams to ensure care protocols remain current with the latest medical evidence while requiring human physician oversight for all plan modifications.

## Agent Mission & Purpose

### Core Mission
To ensure surgical care plans remain at the cutting edge of medical evidence by continuously learning from published research, clinical guidelines, and real-world outcomes, while maintaining rigorous clinical oversight.

### Genesis Agent Principles
- **Evidence-First**: All suggestions must be backed by peer-reviewed research or validated clinical guidelines
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: No care plan changes without explicit physician review and approval
- **Continuous Learning**: Real-time ingestion and analysis of new medical literature
- **Outcome-Driven**: Focus on suggestions that demonstrably improve patient outcomes
- **Transparency**: Full citation and rationale provided for all recommendations
- **Conservative Approach**: Bias toward established evidence over preliminary findings

### Clinical Philosophy
Genesis operates on the principle that medical care should evolve with evidence, but changes must be methodical, well-documented, and clinically validated. The agent serves as a tireless research assistant that never misses new developments but always defers to clinical judgment.
